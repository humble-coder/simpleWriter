# About SimpleWriter

SimpleWriter is a basic wiki-like app that allows real-time editing and chatting among editors. You can play around with it here: https://simple-writer.herokuapp.com. This application started as, and still kind of is, a foray into learning a NOSQL database (Redis), learning how to build primitive login features from scratch via the window API, learning Foundation, and learning how to use web sockets for quick transmission and retrieval of data. I learned a ton while building it, and as with any project, there is still a lot more that can be done.
